## Responsibilities of Community Leaders

Project maintainers and community leaders are responsible for clarifying standards of acceptable behavior and are empowered to take corrective action when behavior violates this Code.  

They may remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, issues, pull requests, or other contributions that are not aligned with these standards, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.
